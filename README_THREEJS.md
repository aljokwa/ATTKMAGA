# Afro Defender - Three.js Edition

This is the Three.js version of Afro Defender, a first-person shooter where you defend yourself against MAGA Trump supporters.

## How to Run the Game

### Option 1: Using Node.js (Recommended)

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. If not, download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the game directory:
   ```
   cd path/to/AfroDefender
   ```

3. Run the server:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```

4. Open your web browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

### Option 2: Using a simple HTTP server

If you have Python installed, you can use its built-in HTTP server:

```
# For Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000

# For Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Then open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

### Option 3: Open the file directly

You can simply open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser, but some browsers might block the loading of scripts for security reasons.
